Basic Usage Example

Here's a quick demonstration of creating a system, performing calculations, and saving/loading its state.

# From the project root, run: python examples/basic_usage.py
from thermodynamics_sdk.core import ThermodynamicSystem, FirstLawCalculator, save_system_to_json, load_system_from_json
import os

# 1. Create a ThermodynamicSystem
system = ThermodynamicSystem(internal_energy=100.0)
print(f"Initial System: {system}")

# 2. Apply changes (heat added TO system, work done BY system)
system.heat_added = 200.0
system.work_done = 70.0
print(f"System after changes: Q={system.heat_added} J, W={system.work_done} J")

# 3. Calculate change in internal energy (ΔU)
delta_u = FirstLawCalculator.calculate_delta_u(system)
print(f"Change in Internal Energy (ΔU): {delta_u} J")
print(f"New Internal Energy: {system.internal_energy + delta_u} J")

# 4. Demonstrate inverse calculation (find Q)
known_delta_u = 50.0
known_work_done = 20.0
calculated_heat = FirstLawCalculator.calculate_heat_added(known_delta_u, known_work_done)
print(f"Given ΔU={known_delta_u} J, W={known_work_done} J: Calculated Q={calculated_heat} J")

# 5. Save and Load System State
json_filename = "my_system_state.json"
save_system_to_json(system, json_filename)
print(f"System state saved to '{json_filename}'")

loaded_system = load_system_from_json(json_filename)
print(f"System state loaded: {loaded_system}")

if os.path.exists(json_filename):
    os.remove(json_filename) # Clean up
    print(f"Cleaned up '{json_filename}'")

Physics Conventions

This SDK adheres strictly to the following conventions:
First Law of Thermodynamics: ΔU = Q - W
ΔU: Change in internal energy.
Q: Heat added to the system (positive for heat entering, negative for heat leaving).
W: Work done by the system (positive for work done by the system on surroundings, negative for work done by surroundings on system).
Units: All energy quantities (internal_energy, heat_added, work_done, delta_u) are treated as scalar float values, representing Joules (J).
No Hidden Conversions: The SDK performs no implicit unit conversions. It is the user's responsibility to ensure all input values are in Joules.
No Implicit Assumptions: Calculations do not assume reversibility, specific process types (e.g., isothermal, adiabatic), or phase behavior.

5. API Overview

thermodynamics_sdk.core.ThermodynamicSystem

Represents a single, lumped thermodynamic system.
__init__(self, internal_energy: float = 0.0, heat_added: float = 0.0, work_done: float = 0.0)
internal_energy (float): Property for the system's current internal energy.
heat_added (float): Property for heat added to the system.
work_done (float): Property for work done by the system.
Type validation is enforced for all fields (must be float or int).
thermodynamics_sdk.core.FirstLawCalculator

Provides static methods for First Law calculations.
calculate_delta_u(system: ThermodynamicSystem) -> float: Returns system.heat_added - system.work_done.
calculate_heat_added(delta_u: float, work_done: float) -> float: Returns delta_u + work_done.
calculate_work_done(delta_u: float, heat_added: float) -> float: Returns heat_added - delta_u.
All methods are deterministic and side-effect free.
JSON Persistence Functions

save_system_to_json(system: ThermodynamicSystem, filename: str) -> None: Serializes a ThermodynamicSystem to JSON.
load_system_from_json(filename: str) -> ThermodynamicSystem: Deserializes a ThermodynamicSystem from JSON.
6. Stability Guarantees

This SDK adheres to Semantic Versioning.
1.x.y Series Guarantees:

Physics Principles: The sign convention (ΔU = Q - W) and the treatment of all quantities as scalars in Joules will never change.
Core API Stability:
The ThermodynamicSystem class, its fields (internal_energy, heat_added, work_done), and their types will remain stable.
The static methods of FirstLawCalculator (calculate_delta_u, calculate_heat_added, calculate_work_done) and their signatures will remain stable.
The save_system_to_json and load_system_from_json function signatures will remain stable.
JSON Schema Stability: The JSON format used for saving/loading ThermodynamicSystem instances is guaranteed stable for the entire 1.x series.
What to Expect in 1.x.y Releases:

Bug fixes.
Documentation improvements.
Non-breaking additional helper methods (e.g., new utility functions that do not alter existing API).
Breaking Changes:

Any changes that break the above guarantees will result in a major version increment (e.g., 2.0.0).
7. Roadmap

Future major versions (2.0.0+) may include:
New Thermodynamic Laws: Introduction of the Second Law of Thermodynamics (Entropy).
Process Modeling: Abstractions for specific thermodynamic processes (e.g., isothermal, adiabatic).
Units Abstraction: Integration with a units library to handle unit conversions explicitly.
Multi-component Systems: Support for interactions between multiple systems.
Advanced Property Models: Integration with material property databases or equations of state.
